# Presentations
Presentations on projects I've created or helped create. These presentations have been made using [Big](https://github.com/tmcw/big), sometimes collaboratively with other people (see individual directories).

## To View Them
- Go to `http://clhenrick.io/presentations/<presentation-name>` where `<presentation-name>` is the spelled the same as the directory in this repo.

- Use your &#9664; and &#9654; keys to navigate.

- links have a cyan background color, click on them to visit. (warning, poor UX will also make the slides advance, blame BIG!)

- Open developer tools and check out the javascript console for notes.

- To export to PDF I used @abenrob's [bigOut.js](https://github.com/abenrob/bigout)
