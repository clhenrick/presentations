NACIS 2015 Mapping For Social Justice presentation notes
========================================================

- Hi, my name is Chris Henrick, I have a background in cartography and GIS, currently work as a web-developer, recently completed MFA Design Technology program at Parsons the New School For Design

- Concept is to use NYC open data, technology and personal narratives to prevent the displacement of residents.

PROBLEMS:

- Disconnect between local government and residents

- developers have too much power and don’t address community concerns

- landlords get away with illegal practices like tenant harassment and lying to tenants about their rent regulation status

- most tenants aren’t aware of their legal rights and are afraid of landlord retaliation

PROJECTS:

Bushwick Community Map redesign:

  - improving technical parts for better performance

  - improving the design & UX

  - giving it context with narrative

Am I Rent Stabilized

  - educate tenants about rent regulation

  - motivate them to take action

  - discrepancy btwn rent stabilized apartments that are registered and not registered with the DHCR

  - CartoDB Map


Landscapes of Profit

  - project for the NYC REIC 

  - developed with Caroline Woolard, Dan Taeyoung, John Krauss, Ingrid Burrington

  - Concept: Proposing a 1% tax on property “flips” (bought & sold within 2 years)

  - rationale: developers benefit financially from community improvements & gentrification but typically don’t give anything back to the community or infrastructure

  - currently in place in other cities such as Philadelphia

  - money would be used to create permanently affordable work spaces or housing

  - Method was to analyze property transfer data to determine an estimate of # of properties sold & how much profit

  - aggregated by City Council to put pressure on Council Members

  - Created a poster that was part of a show at the Storefront For Art and Architecture

  - currently developing an interactive


Tools For Housing Justice

  - New Challenge grant to build an app to help NYC tenants rights organizations utilize open data

  - Partnering with the Cooper Square Committee 

  - App will integrate Building Indicators Project data with Civi-CRM

  - Goal: Integrating qualitative & quantitative data to assist Cooper Square

  - Goal: Case Study / User test to see if it can be affective for tenants-rights groups elsewhere


NEXT STEPS
  
  - continuing to work on Landscapes of Profit interactive & Tools For Housing Justice

  - data updates to Bushwick Community Map



THANK YOU!
