Social Module Presentation Notes
================================
(note: slides moved to thesis-blog/assets/social/) 

## Domain Overlap
- Critical Cartography & Counter Mapping

## Communities & Conferences

## Companies & Non-Profits

## People to potentially interview

- one said yes so far

- hopefully will run into Rebecca Solnit at the Peopleâ€™s Climate March

## Prototype

- showing the intersection of alpha shapes with all urban areas in the world

 - urban with flickr =  magenta
 - urban without flickr = yellow

- 10 minutes of tweets over layed temporally

- Q: Where is social media coming from?

### How:

- not just using a GUI
- used PostgreSQL & PostGIS

## explain alpha shapes

- using a photos meta data: WOE ID, Lat, Lon to aggregate locations into shapes

explain twitter streaming API

- 10 minutes = ~75,000 geotagged tweets out of 120,000 total


### Why?

- Q: what can data from social media tell us about place?

- Q: Can this data be leveraged in a way that makes mapping more humanistic and democratic?

- still thinking about this.
