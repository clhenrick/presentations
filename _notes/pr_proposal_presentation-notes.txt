1. Domains: 
  - Activism around affordable housing & anti-displacement, Participatory Mapping, Technology
  - explain what affordable housing and displacement mean
  - why the word dis-placement over gentrification
  - specifically in NYC

2. some Background

3. Historical Context

4. 3 of many structural practices by government, banks and financial institutions that led to current issues around affordable housing and displacement.

5. Red Lining: 
   - racist practice of denying loans to residents of specific areas based on race
   - issued by the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation starting in the late 1940’s and continuing up to recently
   - maps show the areas that have been redlined
   - also demonstrates the “power of maps” as socio-political artifacts that can directly impact people’s lives, rather than as objective and truth

6. Urban Renewal: 
   - city plans that called for demolishing parts of neighborhoods designated as “blighted” 
   - designation by city officials not the people who lived there
   - cities received federal money to buy and clear land and supposedly relocate people to new development
   - Areas designated for demolition were given urban renewal plans (also known as master plans) 
   - some of which are still in effect today, some stipulate that land must be used for open or public space

7. Dis-investment led to firehouses being closed and landlords using arson to get insurance money for properties.
  - RAND corporation report influential to this policy in that it concluded when services such as police, garbage disposal and fire were withdrawn that people would leave.
  - in the south Bronx and parts of Brooklyn services were reduced, such as closing fire houses and not maintaining water and fire hydrant infrastructure. 
  - Became known as “the Bronx is Burning” as landlords used arson to avoid paying taxes on property and get insurance money
  - “The number of fires from 1960 to 1977 increased from 60,941 to 129, 619. False alarms also rose, going from 89,432 in 1960 to 263, 659 in 1970.” 40% of Bronx’s fires, 4500, were arson in 1974 (NYC Fire Museum)
  - policy became known as “Planned Shrinkage” by which cities in the 1960’s and 70’s dealt with urban blight and a loss of tax revenue. 
  - Recently happened in Detroit when the city shut off water to poor residents with unpaid bills.


8. Fast forward to today

9. a huge amount of global capital being invested into real estate prior to and following the economic collapse in 2007/2008

10. Real estate speculation has led to buying of land and massive building of luxury apartments 
  - while the affordable housing stock has dwindled and 
  - tenants are displaced due to rising rents, wrongful evictions, landlord harassment, buy-outs, not knowing their legal rights.

11. info graphic showing financial trends in housing post-crash of 2007-8

12. Deblasio’s mission to create and preserve affordable housing, 
   - yet the emphasis really needs to be placed on the preservation part due to calculation of AMI
   - Fed goverment says that 30% of AMI is “affordable” rent but many people pay 50% of their income to rent

13. We’re losing true affordable housing units, building new “affordable” housing isn’t going to solve the problem alone

14. Research Questions

15. community organizing practices (Cooper Square Committee in the LES, Northwest Bushwick, MTOPP)

16. how are (participatory) mapping and GIS able to assist? Anti-eviction mapping project

17. 

18. Precedents

19. Anti-Eviction

20. Why Don’t We Own This

21. 596 Acres

22. Urban Reviewer

23. Northwest Bushwick Community Map

24. Methodology

25. probably won’t have time to implement true PAR 
    - but will seek to use other forms of qualitative and participatory research.

26. timeline

27. Help me plan for my MFA thesis project and potentially propose a PAR methodology for helping communities resist displacement
  - already done some interviews, group discussions, participated in a participatory mapping project in Bushwick, went to a community group meeting in my neighborhood and helped them with some data retrieval
  - planning on assisting the bushwick group with some web design
