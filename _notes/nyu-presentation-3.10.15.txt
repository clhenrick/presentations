NYU presentation notes
======================

- Hi, my name is chris henrick, I’m a second year graduate student at Parsons MFA Design Technology program at the New School

- Concept is to use NYC open data, technology and personal narratives to prevent the displacement of residents.

PROBLEMS:

- Disconnect between local government and residents

- developers have too much power and don’t address community concerns

- landlords get away with illegal practices like tenant harassment and lying to tenants

- most tenants aren’t aware of their legal rights and are afraid of landlord retaliation

PROJECTS:

- Bushwick Community Map redesign:

  - improving technical parts for better performance

  - improving the design & UX

  - giving it context with narrative

- Am I Rent Stabilized

  - educate tenants about rent regulation

  - motivate them to take action

  - discrepancy btwn rent stabilized apartments that are registered and not registered with the DHCR

  - CartoDB Map


- Scraping ACRIS data for MTOPP

  - MTOPP identified an area of concern

  - ACRIS data exists but not user friendly or machine readable

  - used GIS to identify multiple BBLs

  - wrote a script to grab the HTML tables, parse them to CSV files

  - tenants rights and community groups need access to this data


- NYC Property Data Extractor

  - designing a better interface for inspecting and retrieving PLUTO tax lot data

  - still a work in progress

  - Goal to simply and improve access to data on NYC properties

  - because access to and using the data is not user friendly


NEXT STEPS

  - create more applications that use open data to combat displacement

  - incorporate the personal narratives of residents with the data

  - bridge the communication gap between city officials and residents


THANK YOU!
