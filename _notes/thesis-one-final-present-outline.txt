Final present outline
=====================

1. Concept: To utilize D&T to combat the displacement of NYC residents from hyper-gentrification.

  - stems from several problems:

     1. Hyper gentrification (luxury development) is rapidly displacing NYC renters.

     2. Most tenants are not aware of their rights.

     3. Most tenants do not understand the processes that lead to displacement.

2. Prototypes going backwards chronologically

  A. *Am I Rent Stabilized dot com

    i. goals: 

     - inform users about rent-regulation in NYC
     - motivate them to take action to protect themselves

    ii. stems from a discrepancy between reported and non-reported rent-stabilized apartments

    ( show cartodb map & explain process )

  B. Web Scraping NYC Property Transaction Data

    i. goal: provide access to property transaction history to tenants rights group
   
    ii. problem: property history is open but not accessible in a user friendly manner


  C. NYC Property Data Extractor

    i. goal: to make open data on NYC properties more accessible

    ii. stems from doing pro-bono work for tenants rights groups 
         
         - people not knowing how to get info

         - open data being stored in proprietary formats (GIS)

    iii. problem: would this benefit developers more than tenants & advocates of tenants rights?


— — — connect prototypes to end product — — — 
— target audience
— stake holders

- goal: create an empathetic response from the audience

3. Moving Forward

  A. Currently conducting ethnographic research with residents who have experienced displacement
    (being priced out, landlord harassment, illegal evictions)

  B. Goal: Design A spatial narrative around people’s experiences with displacement while also showing
     how luxury development contributes to it.

  C. End product: A walking tour of displacement narratives in Bushwick (qualitative)
       while also using data visualization to show how changes in the build environment correlate with these experiences (quantitative)

  D. Goal: to spread awareness about landlord harassment, illegal practices and developers' lack of accountability

EXTRA:

1. Domains: 

  - Critical Cartography
  - Critical GIS
  - Counter Mapping
  - Civic Tech

  - design & technology as a social practice

2. Data Processing

  - DHCR data FOIL’d
  - Map Pluto GIS data

  - querying map pluto & joining against DHCR

3. Questions:

  - Is open data really open? 
 
  - how can open data be leveraged for civic engagement and transparency in local gov’t?
